# SOC Log Analysis – Bootcamp Simulation

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. It demonstrates the process of detecting, analyzing, and responding to suspicious activity using SIEM tools and network traffic analysis.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Splunk (Cloud lab)  
- Wireshark  
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework  
- PCAP Files  

## 🛡️ Key Tasks
- Parsed and filtered Windows event logs  
- Correlated alerts to detect brute force attempts and suspicious logins  
- Analyzed PCAP traffic to identify anomalies (e.g., unauthorized FTP transfers)  
- Mapped attacker behavior to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Documented findings and incident response steps  

## 📌 Status
In Progress – Additional data and detection rules being added.
